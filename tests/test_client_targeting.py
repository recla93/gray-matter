"""Where MCP servers get written, and who decides.

Two real defects are pinned here:

* **VS Code**: 1.102 moved MCP servers into `User/mcp.json`. All three tools
  targeted `User/settings.json` only, so entries went where a current VS Code
  never looks — and `deregister` could not SEE a server that lived in mcp.json.
  Observed 2026-07-29: a legacy `neuron5` in mcp.json survived
  `deregister_all('neuron5')`, which cheerfully reported "not registered".

* **Choice**: registration was all-or-one. The user must be able to say WHICH
  clients get touched, and a prompt nobody can answer must fall back to a safe
  default rather than registering nothing.
