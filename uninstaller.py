"""GM uninstaller + legacy scan (INSTALLER-UX §6).

Pure planning brain (`plan`, `legacy_scan_plan`) — fully testable, no side effects.
The effectful steps it emits (kill processes, deregister clients, remove files) run
**locally** (they touch live processes, the 6 client configs and the disk).

Data policy = INTERACTIVE (user's choice): the user's memory (graph/DB/bridges)
becomes `ask_data` actions — never removed without an explicit yes. `purge_data=True`
downgrades them to `remove_data` for a full wipe.

    Order: reap live processes → deregister from clients → remove per-client hooks
    → remove code/binaries → handle the memory (ask, or wipe if purge_data) → the

    The venv is asked about, never assumed: it is shared, so removing it takes
    Neuron's and NeuRAG's runtime with it (`venv_peers` names who else is in
    there). `purge_data` does NOT imply it — that flag is about the user's
