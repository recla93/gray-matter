"""GM-centric installer orchestration (INSTALLER-UX §5).

The idempotency brain is the pure `plan()` — fully testable, no side effects. The
effectful steps it emits (reap processes, spawn/upgrade GM, register in clients,
write manifest) are executed by thin wrappers run **locally** (they touch the OS,
the 6 client configs and live processes, so they can't be verified in the sandbox).

Two decisions are hard-coded here, matching the proxy model:
  - register **only the gateway** (Gray-Matter) in MCP clients — never the
    sub-servers, which run as GM-managed workers;
  - idempotent: install GM only if missing; reap orphan processes before writing.
